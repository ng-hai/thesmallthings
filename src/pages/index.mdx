# Hi, I’m Hải.

I’m a web engineer. I grew up in Bao Loc, currently living in Saigon, Vietnam.

After graduating from the University of Science (HCMUS) in 2016, I worked with [DSquare](https://dsquare.com.vn/ "Digital Agency"), [The Coffee House](https://www.thecoffeehouse.com/ "Food & Beverages"), and [be](https://be.com.vn "On-demand Transportation").

When not crafting web applications, or reading about web development, I spend time on doing sports activities and sometimes cooking.

If you have any questions or any ideas to share, feel free to [leave a message here](/contact).
