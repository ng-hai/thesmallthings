# How to use Telegram Bot for Contact Form

I have deleted my Facebook account for 3 months. Now I use Telegram as the main contact point.
When building this _“small universe”_, I find out that I can use Telegram API for sending messages.
A light bulb goes off in my head with an idea, using Telegram Bot for the [Contact Form](/contact).

## How it works

    Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a{" "}
    <a href="/blog/the-small-bot/contact.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.

This feature may be too overkill for a simple contact form, I do it for the sake of learning and creating things.
Let’s jump into building progress.

## Telegram Settings

### Bot

Creating a Telegram Bot is very simple. Telegram has another bot handling that process. Its name is [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). All I have to do is type some commands.

/>

After creating Bot, I receive an authentication token for using the Bots API. It looks like `992219941:AAEEoFKKPN1qJWYZkVoujOFcHysITXa8uAY`. I’ll call `<token>` from now on.

### Group

According to the API documentation, I need a `chat_id` of a group or a channel. The main reason is that a Bot cannot send direct messages to a User.

> `chat_id`: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format `@channelusername`)
>
> <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>

When I have created a group, the first thing to do is give Administrator permission to the Bot.

  style={{ maxWidth: 516, width: "100%" }}
/>

To find `chat_id`, I go to Group Type. A group is set to Private by default. It has a sharable link to join the group below, something like `https://t.me/joinchat/<id>`.

At first, I’m quite sure that the `<id>` here is `chat_id`, but when I put it into the API call, it fails immediately. After a lot of attempts, the only way to get the format `@channelusername` is to set Group Type to Public. So that I can have the group `username` as purpose. For me, `chat_id` will be `@TheSmallUniverse`.

### Telegram API

Now I already have `<token>` and `chat_id`, the next step is to connect the API. Following the documentation, [Send Message API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage) is the only API that I need.

```sh filename=Terminal
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "chat_id": "@TheSmallUniverse",
  "text": "Hello Darkness, my old friend!"
}'
```

And here is the response I get when running the command. There is a different detail, `chat_id` has changed to an Integer `-1001258275042`.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "message_id": 5,
    "from": {
      "id": 992219941,
      "is_bot": true,
      "first_name": "The Small Bot",
      "username": "TheSmallBot"
    },
    "chat": {
      "id": -1001258275042,
      "title": "The Small Universe",
      "username": "TheSmallUniverse",
      "type": "supergroup"
    },
    "date": 1578890703,
    "text": "Hello Darkness, my old friend!"
  }
}
```

## Contact Form

The configuration for Telegram is done. I need an UI to apply that functionality, and nothing better than a Contact Form.

### User Interface

A meaningful message needs to have sender name, email and message content. As Telegram supports message formatting (Markdown & HTML), I come up with this interface.

<ContactForm className="my-8" style={{ maxWidth: 480 }} />

On the client-side, I use [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) – a form validation library. When submitting the form, it calls an internal API, which is a simple serverless function.

### Serverless Function

I use Next.js, which supports [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) out of the box.
If I don’t use Next.js, I could do this functionality with [Zeit Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) or [Netlify Functions](https://functions.netlify.com/).

The function looks like this:

```js filename=messages.js
export default async (req, res) => {
  const { name, message, email } = req.body

  if (!name || !message || !email) {
    res.status(400).json({
      ok: false,
      status: 400,
      message: "Missing required fields",
    })

    return
  }

  // https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdownv2-style
  const escapedEmail = email.replace(/_/g, "\\_")

  fetch(`https://api.telegram.org/bot${process.env.botToken}/sendMessage`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      chat_id: process.env.chatId,
      parse_mode: "Markdown",
      text: `“${message}”\n— ${name} <${escapedEmail}>`,
    }),
  })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => res.status(200).json(data))
    .catch((err) => res.status(err.status).json(err))
}
```

During local development, I create a `.env` file at the root of the project directory. It contains environment variables values.

```sh filename=.env
CHAT_ID="@TheSmallUniverse"
BOT_TOKEN="992219941:AAEEoFKKPN1qJWYZkVoujOFcHysITXa8uAY"
```

For production, I add these values to [Now Secrets](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets). They will be available at Build Time.
As I use Zeit Now service, all I have to do is config `now.json` file.

```json filename=now.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "The Small Things",
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "CHAT_ID": "@thesmallthings.chat-id",
      "BOT_TOKEN": "@thesmallthings.bot-token"
    }
  }
}
```

Then declare `botToken` and `chatId` in the `next.config.js` as environment variables.

```js filename=next.config.js
// Use `dotenv` for local .env file
require("dotenv").config()

const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    chatId: process.env.CHAT_ID,
    botToken: process.env.BOT_TOKEN,
  },
}
```

## Private Group

In my case, I don’t want to expose those messages for anyone in Telegram, so I set the group to Private.

At first, the [Send Message API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage) doesn’t accept `@TheSmallUniverse` as `chat_id`.
Because when moving group to Private, its sharable link has changed. So the old `chat_id` won’t be available anymore.
Luckily, I have the Integer `chat_id` from the previous API call.

```json
{
  "chat": {
    "id": -1001258275042,
    "title": "The Small Universe",
    "username": "TheSmallUniverse",
    "type": "supergroup"
  }
}
```

Replace that value to `.env` file, the function works as expected.

```sh filename=.env
CHAT_ID="-1001258275042"
BOT_TOKEN="992219941:AAEEoFKKPN1qJWYZkVoujOFcHysITXa8uAY"
```

But then, when I try to update Now Secrets for `chat_id`, I get this error

```sh filename=Terminal
now secret add thesmallthings.chat-id -1001258275042
> Error! Invalid number of arguments. Usage: `now secret add <name> <value>`
```

That's because the secret value cannot contain the dash character.
After searching for a while, I come across [this solution](https://github.com/zeit/now/issues/749#issuecomment-533873759).

At the root of the project directory, I create a `chat-id.txt` file, its content is the `chat_id` value.
Then update the command to use that file:

```sh filename=Terminal
now secret add -- thesmallthings.chat-id "`cat chat-id.txt`"
> Success! Secret thesmallthings.chat-id added [762ms]
```

The `cat chat-id.txt` takes the content of the `chat-id.txt` file and pastes it into the command line for me.

And, what’s done is done. Now I have an helpful way to receive messages from anyone.
